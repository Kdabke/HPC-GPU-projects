Two different TCR-seq tools compared for understanding the T cell receptor repertoire of HGSOC from bulk RNA-seq 
data

## MiXCR: https://mixcr.com/

"mixcr_script.sh" script to run mixcr with paired .fastq files

## TRUST4: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01142-2

"trust4_script.sh" script to run TRUST4 with .BAM files from local project in hg38

"trust4_script_bowtell_hg19.sh" script to run TRUST4 with .BAM files in hg19 from Bowtell study: 
https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14410

# outputs from both tools were further processed with immunarch: https://immunarch.com/

Analysis done with the two tools for T cell receptors:

1. Distribution of CDR3 lengths and plotting CDR3 sequence logo for the most frequent length of sequence (14 aa)
2. Calculate clonotype count and diversity (Gini-Simpson index)
3. Top clonal proportions and rare clonal proportions
4. Repertoire overlap
5. Gene usage
